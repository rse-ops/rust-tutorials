# Rust Tutorials 

This repository contains rust tutorials! It is an experiment to get ready
for testing a new lab playground where a visitor can request a VSCode
interface to try out software. The repository will provide (optionally)
automated builds for containers, or the tutorial can be used statically.
from [here](https://github.com/rse-ops/rust-tutorials).

You can look at the [tutorial-actions](https://github.com/rse-ops/tutorial-actions)
to better understand the automation and assets here. Each tutorial is focused
around learning or trying a piece of software, and we will have a tool
that can easily deploy them.
